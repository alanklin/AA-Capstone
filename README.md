### Problem Statement
We want to use United States Customs and Border Patrol (BCP) data to accurately predict the number of migrant encounters along the United States' borders and points of entry. The data collected ranges from FY2020-FY2025 and contains encounters aggregated by country of origin, encounter location, and the traveling status of the migrant. The purpose of this forecasting is to provide better insight to BCP for resource allocation and distribution.
